Current version:
        * pykaraoke.py: Allow WxPython v2.8, fix usage of system variable
	name now used by Wx 2.8.
 
	* _pycdgAux.c, pycdgAux.py: Fix potential array bounds problem
	with corrupt CDG data.

	* pykaraoke.py: More sensible sizing of column in search results
	and made Title and Artist columns more visible.

	* pykaraoke.py: Check for WxPython v2.6.

	* Reduced size of visible display of CDG graphics from 294x204 to
	288x192, based on a new understanding of a presumed typo in the
	CDG document.  This appears to solve some minor scrolling issues.
	
v0.5:

	* Fixed a problem in pykar.py with synchronization of lyrics to
	music on certain MIDI files (files in which the tempo changes
	during the song).

	* Reworked rendering engine in pykar.py to support wordwrap and
	font scaling.

	* Wrote pykaraoke_mini.py, with an in-window scrolling interface
	for environments in which a full keyboard/mouse is not available.

	* Added pykplayer.py and pykmanager.py to collect together common
	bits of code between the various player types.

	* Made command-line options available to all public entry points:
	pycdg.py, pykar.py, pymgr.py, pykaraoke.py, and pykaraoke_mini.py.

	* Replaced threading code with explicit calls to manager.Poll().

	* Moved the CDG-processing code from pycdg.py into pycdgAux.py,
	and also ported it down to C in _pycdgAux.c for further runtime
	optimization.

	* Pushed default framerate back to 30 fps.  Setting it lower than
	that has limited benefit with the new codebase.

	* Added --zoom to control the mode in which pycdg.py scales its
	display to fit the window.

	* Added command-line parameters to control audio properties.

	* Added separate "titles" and "artists" columns to the song
	database, making it possible to sort the returned songlist by any
	of the three columns.  The file titles.txt can be defined in the
	directory with all of your song files to define the title and/or
	artist for each song.

	* Ported to the GP2X.

	* Fixed horizontal scrolling CDGs.

	* Smoother CDG scrolling.
	
v0.4.3:
	* pycdg.py: Fix "scratchy" audio on some systems.

	* pykar.py: Support non-ASCII, non-unicode charsets <mantask>.

	* pykaraoke.py: Add charset option & launch from command-line
	<mantask>.

	* pykaraoke.desktop: Add task-launcher file for file associations 
	<mantask>.

	* pykaraoke.py: Show pykaraoke.xpm icon as WX window icon.

v0.4.2:
	* pycdg.py: Allow CDG filenames without extension (just a .) to allow for 
	tab-completion.

	* pycdg.py: Fix border preset (don't clear full-screen).

	* pycdg.py: Add --nomusic option.

	* pycdg.py: pycdg: Fix option type 'str' in optparse

	* pycdg.py: pycdg: Fix FutureWarning on 0xFFFFFFFFs

	* pykaraoke.py: Add drag-and-drop support from search results and within
	playlist.

	* pykaraoke.py: Add drag-and-drop from Folder View

	* pykaraoke.py: Reuse PyKaraoke without the GUI from Craig Rindy:
	scripters might find it useful to reuse many things
	implemented in pykaraoke.py such as zip file handling.
	The attached patch allows the pykaraoke module (in
	particular PyKaraokeManager) to be used without the
	main application window. The patch also includes a
	refactoring of SongDB.FolderScan to allow for reuse.

	* pykaraoke.py: Support non-ASCII characters in filenames from Craig Rindy:
	Any valid file can be imported, and filenames that present
	problems in the search are skipped so that the search may
	continue through the rest of the database.
	
v0.4.1:

	* pycdg.py: Fix typo in "CDG file may be corrupt" warning (wwf)

	* pycdg.py: Add -t/--title option to set the window title to 
	something specific (useful for window managers that can remember
	window settings like sticky, size, location, stacking, desktop,
	etc., based on window title/name/class attributes, like 
	Enlightenment does) (wwf)

	* Add install script and /usr/bin links in install directory.
	
	* Get icons and fonts from current directory or /usr/share/pykaraoke.

	* Use /usr/bin/env for shebang.
	
	* pykaraoke.py: Add KAR inside ZIP fix from Andrei Gavrila.
	
	* pykaraoke.py: Add mid/mpg extension fix from Andrei Gavrila.

	* pycdg.py: Default to 10 frames per second.

	* pycdg.py: Fix scrolling variable names

	* pykaraoke.py: Fix wx 2.6 API change.

	* pycdg.py: Split the screen into 24 tiles for better screen 
	update performance.
	
	* pycdg.py: Lower delay time when no packets are due.
	
	* pycdg.py: Don't update the screen if 1/4 second out of sync.
	
	* pycdg.py: Don't specify the display depth, pygame will use the
	most appropriate.

v0.4:

	* Use optparse to support additional command-line options
	(optparse is included in Python 2.3 and newer, on all standard
	Python-supporting platforms); run "pycdg.py --help" to see a full
	list of supported options.

	* Permit user to specify window's starting X and Y positions

	* Permit user to specify window's starting X and Y sizes

	* Permit user to start the player in fullscreen mode

	* Permit user to specify FPS on command line, defaults to 60

	* Pass cdgPlayer.__init__() an "options" object now instead of a
	filename; contains size_x, size_y, pos_x, pos_y, fullscreen,
	cdgFileName

	* cdgPlayer.run(): it's pedantic, but use self.Close() instead of
	setting self.State manually

	* Add key binding "q" to exit ([ESC] still works)

	* Hide the mouse cursor (both in fullscreen and in windowed mode)

	* Fix "Frames Per Second" so it's honored (previously it was
	ignored because curr_pos wasn't always updated as often as needed)

	* Change order of import statements so local versions of pygame,
	Numeric can be picked up if present.

	* Check for all mixed-case cases of matching audio files (mp3,
	ogg)

	* Misc. tab/spacing fixes in "constant" definitions

v0.3.1:

	* Added full-screen player mode (CDG and MPG)

	* Supports the latest WxPython (v2.6)

	* Improved CPU usage

	* Displays ZIP filename together with the internal song filename

v0.3:

	* Added MIDI/KAR file support

	* CDG player now uses psyco for faster playback on low-end
	machines

	* Better handling of corrupt CDG rips

	* Minor changes to make it more OSX-friendly

	* Added facility for cancelling song database builds in PyKaraoke
	GUI

v0.2.1:

	* Fixed colour cycling in the CDG player

	* Fixed transparent colours used in CDG files

	* Searches are optimised to handle thousands of CDG files very
	quickly

	* Fixed inaccurate right-clicking in the playlist on some systems
