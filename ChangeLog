v0.5:
	* Request hardware-accelerated and double-buffered displays from SDL
	when available (wwf)

	* Fix typo in "CDG file may be corrupt" warning (wwf)

	* Add -t/--title option to set the window title to something specific
	(useful for window managers that can remember window settings like
	sticky, size, location, stacking, desktop, etc., based on window
	title/name/class attributes, like Enlightenment does) (wwf)
